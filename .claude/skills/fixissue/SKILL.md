# Fix Issue

End-to-end issue resolution.

## Workflow

1. **Understand** — read the issue; reproduce if possible; find root cause
2. **Fix** — fix root cause, not symptoms; refactor if needed
3. **Test** — add regression test that fails before fix, passes after; run full suite
4. **Verify** — build + lint + docs:
   ```bash
   # adapt to project toolchain
   bin/validate-docs
   ```
5. **Commit** — use `/committer` skill; Conventional Commits (`fix: ...`)
6. **Close** — comment on issue with what changed; close if appropriate
   - No issue URL/number? Ask before closing.
