# Guardrails

## Work Style

- Telegraph; noun-phrases ok; drop grammar; min tokens in replies
- Keep files <500 LOC; split/refactor as needed
- Prefer end-to-end verify; if blocked, say what's missing

## Git

- Safe by default: `git status/diff/log` first
- Push only when user asks
- Conventional Commits: `feat|fix|refactor|build|ci|chore|docs|style|perf|test`
- No amend unless asked; no force push unless explicit
- Stage specific files, never `.`
- Big review: `git --no-pager diff --color=never`

## Docs

- Run `/docs-list` before coding; honor `read_when` hints
- Update docs when behavior/API changes — no ship without docs
- Add `read_when` hints on cross-cutting docs

## Build/Test

- Before handoff: run full gate (build, test, lint, format check, validate-docs)
- CI red: fix, push, repeat til green

## Critical Thinking

- Fix root cause, not band-aid
- Unsure: read more code; if still stuck, ask with short options
- Unrecognized changes: assume other agent; keep going; focus your changes

## Hooks

Active hooks in `.claude/settings.local.json` — these fire automatically:

| Hook | Trigger | Effect |
|------|---------|--------|
| `block-protected-files.sh` | PreToolUse (`Edit\|Write`) | Blocks edits to lock files, generated paths, build output |
| `block-push.sh` | PreToolUse (`Bash(git push)`) | Blocks `git push` — requires explicit user approval |

## Skills

- `/pickup` — context rehydration
- `/handoff` — review verdict + issue next directives
- `/receive` — receive and review coding agent deliverables
- `/validate` — full verification suite
- `/fixissue` — end-to-end issue resolution
- `/committer` — safe git commits
- `/docs-list` — documentation discovery
